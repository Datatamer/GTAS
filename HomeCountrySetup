SETTING UP HOME COUNTRY AND DASHBOARD AIRPORT TO LOAD AND WATCH INCOMING AND OUTGOING FILGHTS.

To set up the home country for the loader to determine the incoming and outgoing flights modify the below entries in 

\gtas-parent\gtas-commons\src\main\resources\sql\gtas_data.sql file.

1).insert into app_configuration (opt, val, description) values('HOME_COUNTRY', 'USA', 'home country for the loader to determine incoming/outgoing flights');
             Where val "USA" needs to be replaced with the interested country that is going to install GTAS application.
             Make sure this is a three letter conuntry code.

2).insert into app_configuration (opt, val, description) values('DASHBOARD_AIRPORT','IAD','Dashboard Airport');
            Where val "IAD" needs to be replaced with the interested Airport that is going to idisplay on the Dash board.
3).insert into app_configuration (opt, val, description) values('HOURLY_ADJ','-5','Dashboard Time Adjustment');
	    Where val '-5' need to be modified according to your GMT/UTC offset.


The values of "HOME_COUNTRY" and and "DASHBOARD_AIRPORT" can be retrieved programmatically using the method
public String getAppConfigOption(String option) of \gtas-parent\gtas-commons\src\main\java\gov\gtas\repository\LookUpRepository by passing the appropriate options.

Ex: String value=getAppConfigOption("HOME_COUNTRY");

Loader is using the "HOME_COUNTRY" value from app_configuration table and changing/modifying the gtas_data.sql will allow you to set the Home country at installation.


There are two other places where the hardcoded value of 'DASHBOARD_AIRPORT' need to be modified.

1)./gtas-parent/gtas-webapp/src/main/webapp/dashboard/DashboardController.js: "title": "IAD"
2)./gtas-parent/gtas-webapp/src/main/webapp/dashboard/DashboardController.js: "label": "Flights To IAD"

The "IAD" airport value can be replaced with the Airport code you are interested in the files.
